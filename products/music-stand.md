## What It Is
A dedicated digital music stand app that is an add-on to Planning Center Services (not a standalone product). It turns Services plan song data into a ready-to-use music reading experience for musicians, with annotation, foot pedal support, and external display mirroring. Tagline: "Equip your musicians to play their best."

## Pricing
Add-on to Planning Center Services -- requires an active Services subscription. Cannot be subscribed to independently. Every team member with Services access automatically gets Music Stand access once enabled.

| Services Plan | Music Stand Price |
|--------------|------------------|
| 50 Team Members | $5/mo |
| 150 Team Members | $10/mo |

The app itself is free to download on iOS and Android.

## Core Capabilities

### Music Display & Navigation
- PDFs from Services plans display as a digital music stand; select a date and PDFs load automatically
- Page turning via tap, swipe, foot pedal, or external keyboard
- Landscape and portrait orientation; zoom capabilities
- Page reordering within the app (does not affect the Services source)
- Light and dark mode for different environments (stage vs. rehearsal)
- Choose between PDF versions when multiple are available

### Annotations
- Add personal annotations (notes, markings, highlights, drawings) directly on PDFs
- Apple PencilKit integration on iOS for natural writing
- Annotations persist across sessions; can be shared with team members or printed
- Access other team members' annotations for reference

### Lyrics & Chords
- Edit lyrics and chords directly in the app
- Quick transpose to change song key on the fly (reflects key set in Services)

### Audio & Metronome
- Built-in metronome with visual flash option
- Audio looping and playback for rehearsal sections
- Metronome sync across multiple devices via Ableton Link

### Multi-Device & Hardware
- Link multiple devices so worship leader controls page turns for the whole band
- External display connection (HDMI/AirPlay) for stage monitors or projection
- Foot pedal support: recommended AirTurn DUO 500 and BT500S-2; any Bluetooth/USB keyboard-style pedal works
- Offline capability: data downloads for use without internet during service

### Order of Service
- View and navigate the order of service within the app
- Follows plan structure from Services; can reorder locally without affecting the plan

## Key Workflows
1. **Setup**: Download app -> Log in with Planning Center credentials -> Select church organization
2. **Preparation**: Open upcoming service date -> PDFs auto-load -> Add annotations -> Set key/transposition -> Practice with audio loop and metronome
3. **Rehearsal**: Open plan -> Sync metronome with band via Ableton Link -> Loop sections -> Review annotations
4. **Live performance**: Use foot pedal or tap for page turns -> Dark/light mode as needed -> Link devices for synchronized page control

## Integration Points
- **Services (primary)**: All content flows from Services -- songs, PDFs, arrangements, keys, order of service, audio files
- **Web Music Stand**: Browser-based version accessible from within Services plan pages
- **Ableton Link**: Third-party protocol for metronome sync across devices and apps
- No direct integration with other PC products (Check-Ins, Groups, etc.)

## Notable Details
- Music Stand is a companion to Services, NOT a standalone product -- it has no content of its own
- Charts and audio are only available once added to the Services account first
- iOS version has slightly more features than Android (Apple PencilKit, more pedal compatibility)
- Web Music Stand provides basic functionality for those without the native app
- Annotations are device-specific by default but can be shared
- No Android in-app casting support for Android 12+
- Minimum Android version: Android 5+
- Compatible with iOS and Android only; NOT compatible with Windows devices
- Foot pedal compatibility varies by device and Bluetooth protocol
- Steady but infrequent update cadence
