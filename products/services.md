## Core Capabilities

### Service Types & Plans
- **Service types** are containers for recurring plans (e.g., "Sunday Morning Worship"); organized in folders with a master calendar view
- **Plans** are individual service instances with date, order of service, scheduled teams, files, and notes
- Plans created from scratch, copied from previous plans, or built from reusable templates
- Templates can be exported/imported across organizations
- Plan title and series information for tracking sermon series; plan changes tracked with version history

### Order of Service
- Items represent each service element (songs, media, announcements, prayers, etc.) with configurable lengths for time tracking
- Item row colors for visual categorization; item notes visible to specific teams (e.g., cue notes for production)
- Files (PDFs, audio, images) attached to items or plans; stage layout files for visual reference
- Limited file visibility restricts which teams see specific files; MP3 download permissions per file
- Copyright and license tracking with CCLI integration

### Teams & Scheduling
- Teams are groups serving in specific roles; team positions define specific roles within a team (lead vocals, drums, camera 1)
- **Team types**: Regular, Split (same people across sub-teams), Secure (restricted visibility), Tag (auto-populated from People tags), Rehearsal
- **Scheduling methods**: Manual, auto-scheduling (algorithm-based on last scheduled date/preferences/blockouts), signup sheets (self-service), large group/event scheduling
- Blockout dates, scheduling preferences (preferred times, frequency limits), household scheduling preferences
- The Matrix: grid view for scheduling across multiple plans simultaneously
- Backup teams for automatic replacement when someone declines
- Scheduling emails with accept/decline/decline-and-suggest; configurable reminder emails; email templates
- Automations for routine scheduling tasks to reduce manual follow-up

### Services LIVE
- Real-time service flow management with countdown timers (three modes: Full Item Length, End Item on Time, End Service on Time)
- Now/Next display showing current and upcoming items with notes
- Multiple display formats: Normal Layout (production booth), stage displays, custom displays
- Real-time chat (org-level and service-type-level channels); video support
- Recorded LIVE times saved for future planning reference
- Available on web and mobile; Admins/Editors control by default, Schedulers/Viewers can be granted control

### Songs & Media Library
- Central song library with arrangements, keys, sequences, and tags
- Chord charts (ChordPro format); Lyrics & Chords editor for in-app editing
- Key management with transposition (audio files too); top songs tracking by usage
- Media library for non-song items (videos, graphics); media tagging and filtering
- Song integrations: SongSelect/CCLI, MultiTracks, PraiseCharts, RehearsalPack

## Key Workflows
1. **Setup**: Create service type -> Set schedule -> Create teams with positions -> Add people -> Set preferences/blockouts
2. **Weekly planning**: Create plan (or from template) -> Build order of service -> Attach files/songs -> Schedule teams -> Send scheduling emails -> Handle responses
3. **Pre-service**: Finalize plan -> Share with teams -> Rehearsal via Music Stand or app -> Handle declines with backups
4. **Live service**: Launch Services LIVE -> Control flow -> Team chat -> Track actual vs. planned times
5. **Post-service**: Review recorded times -> Generate reports -> CCLI song usage reporting

## Admin vs Church Center
- **Admin (web/app)**: Full plan creation, team management, scheduling, LIVE control, reporting, song library management
- **Church Center**: Team members view schedule, accept/decline requests, access files, team chat, subscribe to calendar
- Signup sheets can be published to Church Center for self-service scheduling

## Integration Points
- **Check-Ins**: Volunteer attendance sync when event times and location/team names match; absent people report
- **Music Stand**: Pulls plan song data directly; PDFs load automatically for scheduled dates
