## Philosophy
Planning Center's pricing is a core part of its identity and a major competitive differentiator:
- **À la carte** — pick only the products you need, skip the rest
- **Pay for what you use** — each product scales by actual usage metrics, not seat count
- **Completely transparent** — all pricing is public on the website, no sales calls or consultants
- **Monthly only** — no annual contracts, no lock-in (billing can be monthly/quarterly/semi-annual/annual but it's never a contract)
- **No cancellation fees** — downgrade or cancel anytime
- **30-day free trial** — no payment info required upfront
- **Soft plan limits** — Giving, Check-Ins, and Registrations allow occasional overages without penalty

This stands in direct contrast to competitors who use consultants, opaque pricing, and annual contracts.

## Per-Product Pricing

Every product (except People and Home, which are always free) has a **free tier** plus paid tiers that scale by a usage metric specific to that product:

| Product | Free Tier | Scales By | Max Tier |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **People** | Always free | N/A | N/A |
| **Home** | Always free | N/A | N/A |
| **Calendar** | Unlimited events, 1 room | Number of managed rooms | $239/mo (unlimited) |
| **Check-Ins** | 10 daily check-ins | Busiest day's check-in count | $239/mo (unlimited) |
| **Giving** | 10 monthly donations | Total monthly donations | $239/mo (unlimited) |
| **Groups** | 15 group members | Active group members (counted once even if in multiple groups) | $239/mo (unlimited) |
| **Registrations** | 5 event attendees | Largest event's attendee count | $239/mo (unlimited) |
| **Services** | 5 team members (100MB) | People who access the system | $239/mo (unlimited) |
| **Music Stand** | N/A (add-on) | Flat add-on to Services | $5-10/mo |
| **Publishing** | Essential (home page, analytics) | Feature tier (not usage) | $32/mo (premium) |
| **Church Center** | Free base | N/A | N/A |

## Processing Fees (Stripe)

PC uses Stripe for payment processing in Giving and Registrations. Key points:
- **PC does NOT add fees on top of Stripe** — the Stripe rate IS the only fee
- **Discounted rate** negotiated with Stripe (lower than standard Stripe pricing)
- USD rates: **2.15% + $0.30 per card donation**, **0% + $0.30 per ACH transfer**
- Available in: USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand
- No setup fees, no monthly minimums, no cancellation fees from Stripe
- PC has a savings calculator at planningcenter.com/processing-fee to compare against competitors

## Competitive Positioning
