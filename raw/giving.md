## ONLINE CHURCH DONATIONS
Accept all donation types—online giving and in person.
People can give online and through your church’s mobile app via credit or debit card, Apple Pay, ACH bank transfer, and text-to-give.
Congregants can also give in person via cash or check. Count cash donations and enter them manually, and use a digital reader to process checks!

It was important for us to use more of our resources on the mission of the church, rather than dues and processing fees. Planning Center Giving has saved us over $26,000 a year since we left our contracts with another donation platform!

Assistant Director of Finance at ChurchLV
## MOBILE CHURCH APP
Make it easy for people to give from your custom church app.
People can give, see their donation history, and receive online statements right from [Church Center](https://planningcenter.com/church-center)—a mobile app and website where congregants can engage with your church.
With everything in a central place, congregants can give right alongside other activities, like chatting with their group, managing their volunteer schedule, and more.

## ONLINE PROCESSING FEES
Save money with low processing fees for online giving.
All online donations your church accepts through Giving are powered by Stripe—an easy-to-use payment processor with no setup fees, monthly minimums, or cancellation fees.
Stripe’s processing fee is the only processing fee associated with Giving. Planning Center only charges your flat-rate monthly subscription.

## Frequently asked questions about Giving
For in person questions, contact [support](https://www.planningcenter.com/support).
### Can I import donor history?
There are a few ways to input donor history into Giving:[ manually enter donations ](https://pcogiving.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205197090-Batches)from other systems, build an integration to import donations using [our API](https://developer.planning.center/?_ga=2.156981307.1018852164.1544472332-1919617108.1509553569), or check to see if your current donation management provider already has an [integration with Giving](https://www.planningcenter.com/integrations). You can also import your donor's contact information into our member database, Planning Center People. 
### Will Giving replace my general ledger or offer a Quickbooks integration?
Giving is not a replacement for your general ledger. You’ll still need a general ledger to track spending, set budgets, or cut checks. We don’t have a Quickbooks integration, but we do offer CSV exports that can be imported into most accounting software.
### Can I use a different payment processor than Stripe, like Paypal? 
Stripe is the only payment processor supported by Planning Center Giving. However, donations from other payment systems can be added manually in [Batches](https://pcogiving.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205197090-Batches) or programmatically using the [Giving API](https://developer.planning.center/). Some companies have also built [integrations](https://pcogiving.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012332614-Giving-Product-Integrations) that would allow you to use Giving with another donation system. 
### Does Giving work in my country?
Giving is available in the USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand and supports local currencies. Card based donations can be used in all 4 countries. Direct debit (bank transfer) donations are available in the USA and Australia.
### How does Planning Center's processing fees compare to other companies?
You can compare our highly discounted processing fees to the standard rates using our calculator [here](https://www.planningcenter.com/processing-fee)!
