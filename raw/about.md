# We help churches help people.
Planning Center was created to address the pain points of people serving in ministry. Everything we build is designed to help churches help people. And that will never change.

## our story
Many years ago...
![](https://a-us.storyblok.com/f/1002845/1430x915/540d264abf/keyboard-keys.png/m/227x0/filters:format\(webp\):quality\(80\))
![](https://a-us.storyblok.com/f/1002845/2066x1616/0b64159569/jeff-and-aaron.png/m/1033x0/filters:format\(webp\):quality\(80\))
![](https://a-us.storyblok.com/f/1002845/718x671/8385787bf9/jeff-and-stewart-min.png/m/filters:format\(webp\):quality\(80\))
## Our founders, Jeff Berg and Aaron Stewart, worked together at a church in Southern California.
As the Director of Graphics & Web and Director of Music, they wrestled with spreadsheets, juggled countless details, and felt the weight of a complicated and stressful process. ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-apple/img/apple/64/1f44e.png)
So they decided to build a better way—a tool now called **Services** , designed to make organizing Sundays much easier.
![](https://a-us.storyblok.com/f/1002845/3036x1864/80a216da72/church-grayscale.png/m/filters:format\(webp\):quality\(80\))
![](https://a-us.storyblok.com/f/1002845/2212x1724/e95fadd5a2/planning-center-founding-team.png/m/1218x0/filters:format\(webp\):quality\(80\))
![](https://a-us.storyblok.com/f/1002845/718x654/c80eff1db4/we-will-never-be-cms-min.png/m/filters:format\(webp\):quality\(80\))
## They soon realized this new tool could help other churches, too. So in 2006, Planning Center was formed and the team started to grow. 🌱 
To help us scale and manage our growing day-to-day operations, Jeff Spillman was added to the team (yes, another Jeff) and has been a cornerstone of our culture and leadership ever since.  
  
We quickly noticed even more needs churches had in their daily work, so we introduced a few more tools. But we only wanted to build the essentials. As Jeff, our CEO, once said: “We will never be a church management system.”  
  
Never say never, right?
![](https://a-us.storyblok.com/f/1002845/1593x1478/b46758ab21/building-section-2.png/m/filters:format\(webp\):quality\(80\))
![](https://a-us.storyblok.com/f/1002845/2252x1690/a65294279c/banner-pc-not-for-sale.png/m/1122x0/filters:format\(webp\):quality\(80\))
![](https://a-us.storyblok.com/f/1002845/718x654/4c9727c616/pc-not-for-sale-min.png/m/filters:format\(webp\):quality\(80\))
## In the years that followed, we added Giving, Check-Ins, Registrations, and Calendar… and, yes, finally became a complete church management system.
Since then, we’ve doubled down on our commitment to building tools that support churches’ day-to-day ministry work. 🫶  
  
We’re committed to making sure this never changes, so in 2024 we cemented our future as an independent company by forming the [Ministry Centered Foundation](https://www.planningcenter.com/blog/2024/06/a-commitment-for-our-customers-never-being-acquired) and making Planning Center—officially—not for sale.  
  
Today, we have a growing team and a complete system comprised of 11 products that all work together to help churches help people.
