# About Planning Center

**Founded in 2006** by Jeff Berg and Aaron Stewart — two church workers frustrated with managing Sunday services via spreadsheets. They built "Services" to solve their own problem, then realized other churches had the same needs.

Grew by adding tools as ministry needs were identified: Giving, Check-Ins, Registrations, Calendar, and more. Today the platform offers 11 integrated products serving churches of all sizes.
