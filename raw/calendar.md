# Calendar

Centralize event planning and setup. Plan, schedule, and share all of your events, manage your facilities, and track resources from a single church calendar.

## Central Church Calendar

Plan any event and give your entire community a central view of everything happening.

- **See event details:** View time, date, frequency, and description of each event
- **Find specific events:** Filter events by tags to find exactly what you're looking for
- **Add events from across Planning Center:** Sync events from Services, Check-Ins, and other products

## Resource Management

Build a catalog of all spaces and resources available for your events (gym, sanctuary, tables, sound equipment). Designate what you need for each event.

- **Track facilities and resources:** Manage all rooms and equipment from one place
- **Approve facilities requests:** Review and approve room/resource requests from staff
- **Manage scheduling conflicts:** Resolve overlapping reservations for the same space

## Customizable Church Forms

Share forms with staff to book events (team lunches, planning meetings) and with congregation for events (memorial services, weddings). Collect all information needed to plan, organized from the beginning without miscommunications.

## Events on Mobile

People can see the calendar and sign up for events in Church Center (mobile app and website). Included in any Planning Center subscription.

## System Integration

Centralize all planning by organizing every detail from a single system — taking signups, managing volunteers, checking kids in, managing giving. Calendar connects with Services, Registrations, Check-Ins, and other Planning Center products.

## Additional Features

- **iCal file imports:** Move existing events from Google or Outlook by importing an iCal file
- **Event templates:** Create templates for regular events to streamline event creation
