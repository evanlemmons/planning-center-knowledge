  * ### One Free Application

Card payment is preferred, but check is an option. You can pay monthly (card only) or every 3, 6, or 12 months.
  * ### Soft Plan Limits
Giving, Check-Ins, and Registrations plans have soft limits, so you can occasionally exceed them.
  * ### Low Processing Fees
All transactions accepted in Giving and Registrations are processed for a low fee by Stripe.


## Low Processing Fees
Online payments in Giving and Registrations are processed at the lowest available rate by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)—an easy-to-use payment processor with no setup fees, monthly minimums, or cancellation fees. They have the highest level of PCI compliance and are trusted by some of the world's [largest businesses and non-profits](https://stripe.com/customers).
Stripe’s fee is the only processing fee associated with Giving and Registrations. We do not charge any additional fees or beyond your monthly subscription. Use our processing fee calculator to see how much your church can save.
