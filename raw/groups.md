## Frequently asked questions about Groups
For in person questions, contact [support](https://www.planningcenter.com/support).
### How can I take attendance for my groups?
Tally the total number of people in attendance at your meeting by using the free [Church Center mobile app](https://www.planningcenter.com/church-center).
### Can I make a group private?
Yes, you can keep groups hidden from your public group page so only people invited to a particular group can see and access it.
### Can I make group membership confidential or anonymous?
Yes, you can keep a group open for anyone to join, but make the member list anonymous to everyone but the group leader and admins. This option is a perfect way to create space for those in recovering, looking for healing, or facing other challenges.
### Can I use Groups for students?
Our [Terms of Service](https://www.planningcenter.com/terms#section5) prevents children under 13 years old from logging in to Church Center or accessing Group messaging. If you’re looking for a solution to track kids, we suggest connecting with other parents to create a Parents Group or use [Check-Ins](https://www.planningcenter.com/check-ins) to track student attendance.
