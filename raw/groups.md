# Groups

Organize groups, communicate with members. Where pastors, admins, and community leaders can organize groups online, take attendance, and bring people together with messaging.

## Community Management

Create groups of all kinds to organize and cultivate communities. Organize by stage of life, day of the week, location, or create confidential groups for recovery, grief, and support. People can join from your Church Center app and website.

## Leader Tools

Equip group leaders to care for and communicate with people.

- **Take attendance:** Track who's coming, who's missing, and keep attendance data current
- **Communicate:** Make group-wide announcements and facilitate discussion through chat
- **Manage events:** Manage the group calendar and share materials with group members

## Group Engagement Reporting

Track individual group attendance. Use attendance reports to monitor involvement, follow up with anyone who stops attending, and track visitors.

## Church-Wide Group Activity

Gain insight into how people connect with your groups — demographics, attendance frequency, drop-off rates, meeting frequency, and more.

## Mobile Experience (Church Center)

Cultivate community with Church Center (free custom mobile app and website with any subscription).

- **Group chat:** On-the-go messaging so people stay in touch outside weekly meetings

- **Group resources:** Share study materials, curriculum, recommended books, or short videos

## FAQ

**How can I take attendance?**
Tally total number of people at your meeting using the free Church Center mobile app.

**Can I make a group private?**
Yes, keep groups hidden from your public group page so only invited people can see them.

**Can I make group membership confidential or anonymous?**
Yes, keep a group open but make the member list anonymous to everyone except the leader and admins. Ideal for recovery and support groups.

**Can I use Groups for students?**
Terms of Service prevents children under 13 from logging into Church Center or accessing Group messaging. Consider creating a Parents Group or using Check-Ins for student attendance.
