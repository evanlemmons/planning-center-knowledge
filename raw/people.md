# People

Keep people from falling through the cracks. People is the free membership database of the Planning Center platform — where you can centralize information from across your ministries.

## Member Profiles

Collect and store information about all members and how they're involved at your church.

- **Ministry activity:** See all the ways someone engages — attendance, giving, volunteering, and more
- **Email and text:** Track all communication sent and received through People for up to three months
- **Notes:** Save prayer requests, counseling notes, health conditions — anything you want to remember
- **Background checks:** Order and monitor background check completion and expiration dates

## Customizable Profiles

Create the fields you want to get the data you need. Use custom fields for details like communication preferences, baptism dates, or spiritual gifts. Gather information through a public form, or edit manually on a person's profile.

## Real-Time Reporting (Lists)

Create lists to reach the right people.

- **Custom rules and conditions:** Set specific criteria to pull people into a list (show people who meet all, any, or none of your conditions)
- **Refresh automatically:** List results refresh so information is always current
- **Organize lists:** Find by name, campus, category, or starred
- **Contact people:** Send text, email, or Church Center announcement to any list

## Follow-Up Workflows

Track participation and stay in touch with multi-step workflows.

- **Track participation:** Create workflows to track progress toward goals (becoming a member, serving in a ministry) or communication history
- **Capture form responses:** Build forms that automatically add people to workflows based on their responses
- **Follow up automatically:** Add someone to a workflow via automation after they sign up for an event, complete a baptism class, or request to serve
- **Create lists:** Group people who share information (birthdays, new attendees, inactive members) and auto-add them to workflows

## Automation Tools

Automate admin tasks and send simple messages.

- **Profile updates:** Automatically update age, membership status, or primary campus based on profile changes
- **Welcome emails:** Automatically send welcome emails when visitors fill out a connection card
- **Add tasks:** Create automated tasks like ordering background checks for new volunteer signups

## Mobile App and Web (Church Center)

Connect your congregation with each other through Church Center. Invite people to a church-wide directory where they update their profile, view other members, and make connections. Share event signups and record responses through the app.

## System Integration

With every Planning Center product you use, data automatically centralizes into People. Draw insights from data across products and take action via messaging, event planning, and ministry management. Create tasks from anywhere in Planning Center and invite team members to collaborate.

## Additional Features

- **Texting:** Send texts from your own toll-free numbers ($5/month, no setup fees)
- **Forms:** Collect prayer requests, volunteer interest, first-time visitor contact info
- **CSV import:** Import data from your current system into People
- **Duplicate removal:** Merge duplicate profiles and keep data clean

- **Email templates:** Craft and send templated emails to your congregation
