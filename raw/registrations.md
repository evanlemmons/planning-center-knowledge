# Registrations

Create custom signups for all your church events. Simplify signups, coordinate event details, accept payments — and save money you can put back into your ministry.

## Custom Event Signups

Build flexible signups that capture all the details for VBS, camps, retreats, and more.

- **Attendee categories:** Present registration categories (leader, volunteer, participant) or demographics (child, adult, school grade). Tailor the signup for each attendee type
- **Attendance caps:** Set maximum capacity and let attendees select number of people coming
- **Household signups:** Allow families to register together
- **Bonus purchase options:** Include optional extras like shirts, books, or additional activities (arts and crafts, horseback riding at camp)

## Simple Event Signups

Streamlined signups for potlucks, service projects, or conferences.

- **Basic headcount:** People simply select how many people they're bringing or how many tickets they need
- **Multiple event times:** Sign up for a specific date or time
- **Waitlists:** Allow people to sign up for full events and be added if there's an opening

## Payments

Let people pay online, in-person, or with a minimum deposit upfront. Provide discounts and scholarships for anyone in need.

**Processing fees (powered by Stripe):** Only Stripe's processing fee applies — no additional Planning Center fees beyond your subscription.

## Mobile (Church Center)

People can view, sign up, and pay for events from Church Center (mobile app and website) alongside other activities like giving, group chat, and volunteer scheduling.

## Attendee Management

Sort attendees automatically into groups (bus/cabin at camp, age-specific VBS crew, table at dinner) based on registration info. Keep events organized and running smoothly.

## Attendance & Check-In

Take event attendance and check people in. Know exactly who's there and print name tags.
