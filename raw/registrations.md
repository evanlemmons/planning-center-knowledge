Coordinate the details for VBS, camps, retreats, and much more.

Set a maximum capacity for each event and let attendees select the number of people coming.
### Household signups
Allow families to register for events together so they can all get—and stay—connected to the life of your church.

Include optional extras for purchase, like shirts or books, or any additional activities people want to participate in, like arts and crafts or horseback riding at camp.
