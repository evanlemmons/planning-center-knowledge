## Frequently asked questions about Services
For in person questions, contact [support](https://www.planningcenter.com/support).
### Is Services just for worship teams?
Not at all! Services is for anyone who needs to coordinate volunteers or plan services, regardless of the ministry area.
### Do I need to create a new account if my worship team already has one?
No, ask someone on the team to invite you to the existing account. Once they do, you’ll receive an email with instructions on how to set up a password and a great video overview of how to get started.
### Does Services come with a music bank already? How do I get my music library added/transferred?
Services doesn’t come with music, but you can add individual songs to your song library. If you get audio from RehearsalPack, PraiseCharts, RehearsalMix, or SongSelect, you can integrate with them to pull your audio directly into your Services account.
### Where can I get chord charts?
You can import chord charts from MultiTracks, SongSelect, or PraiseCharts directly into Services. If your charts are stored on your computer, you can also add PDFs to your service plan.
### How do I get started?
As you begin setting up your account, we recommend watching [Planning Center University](https://www.planningcenter.com/university), detailed video tutorials that help you get the most out of our products.
