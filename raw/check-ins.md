## FLEXIBLE CHURCH CHECK-IN SYSTEM
Check children in quickly and safely with whatever technology you have on hand.
Create unlimited check-in stations to get children their name tags, parents their security labels, and get everyone where they need to be.
![A kiosk with an iPad showing multiple people being checked in with smiling families in the background at church.](https://www.planningcenter.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1002845%2F1152x1647%2F64b573aa9e%2Fvolunteer-run-station.png&w=828&q=75)
### Volunteer-run station
Volunteers can create profiles to check new children in as they arrive, and check regulars in by searching for their names.
![A phone showing a pre-check barcode for a parent checking their children in to a church event.](https://www.planningcenter.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1002845%2F1152x1647%2F0839691bcd%2Fself-check-for-parents.png&w=828&q=75)
### Self-check for parents
Families can skip the line and check their children in ahead of time on their [Church Center app.](https://www.planningcenter.com/church-center)
![](https://www.planningcenter.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1002845%2F1152x1647%2F8b03c36e58%2Fclassroom-checklist.png&w=828&q=75)
### Classroom checklist
Teachers and volunteers can use a clipboard-style station view to check children in and out of the class.
![A printer printing a name label along with a mobile barcode.](https://a-us.storyblok.com/f/1002845/178x134/f47f72a491/scan-print.svg)
### Use whatever devices you have to check kids in and print labels—even your volunteers’ phones!
Use any combination of iOS or Android devices and print labels on Citizen or Brother printers. You can also use a Mac or Windows computer to print labels on Dymo or Zebra printers
[See a full list here](https://pcocheck-ins.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042109393-Software-and-Hardware-for-Check-Ins)
## CHURCH SECURITY LABELS
Create your own custom name tags and security labels.
Name tags can be informative and fun. Use a custom editor to make special tags noting children’s birthdays, allergies, diaper bags, and contact information.
Check-Ins keeps things secure by automatically restricting certain information—such as child location, or contact information—from the parents’ security label. We don’t want that data falling into the wrong hands!

## Frequently asked questions about Check-Ins
For in person questions, contact [support.](https://www.planningcenter.com/support)
### Do I have to buy special equipment?
Nope! Use any device you have on hand to set up a Check-Ins station—a desktop, laptop, phone, or tablet. But if you’d like to create name tags, you’ll need to set up a printer. Learn which devices are compatible in this _[article.](https://pcocheck-ins.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042109393-Software-and-Hardware-for-Check-Ins)_
### How long does it take to set up Check-Ins?
Creating a Check-Ins event is a quick and easy process! Once your event is set up, give yourself some time to test and fine-tune things like location filters and label selections. We also recommend setting up your printer(s) at least a week in advance to accommodate varying factors you might need to adjust, such as your Internet connection, label types, and device models. 
### What kind of WiFi do I need?
A stable Internet connection is important when using Check-Ins. Plan on a minimum of 5MBPS, but a higher speed will always improve the experience.
### Can I create custom name labels?
Definitely. Our label editor makes it super simple to make custom labels for things like birthdays, medical notes, and volunteer information. See some examples of the labels you can make in [this guide](https://pcocheck-ins.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6826119275675-Common-Labels).
### What kind of reports can I create?
All kinds! Create reports to see total attendance numbers or information about specific people. You can even use a roster station to see classroom attendance and print a report.
