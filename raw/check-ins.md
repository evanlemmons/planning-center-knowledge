# Check-Ins

Keep children safe, give parents peace. Check-Ins helps you check people in and out quickly and safely with a flexible setup.

## Flexible Check-In System

Create unlimited check-in stations to get children their name tags, parents their security labels, and everyone where they need to be.

**Station Types:**
- **Volunteer-run station:** Volunteers create profiles for new children and check regulars in by name search
- **Self-check for parents:** Families check children in ahead of time on Church Center app (skip the line)
- **Classroom checklist:** Teachers/volunteers use clipboard-style station to check children in and out

**Device & Printer Flexibility:**
Use any combination of iOS or Android devices with Citizen or Brother printers. Mac or Windows computers can print on Dymo or Zebra printers.

## Custom Security Labels

Create custom name tags and security labels with:
- Children's birthdays, allergies, diaper bags, contact information
- Automatic restriction of sensitive info (child location, contact info) from parents' security labels

## Classroom Management (Roster Stations)

- **Emergency texting:** Send text to parents if baby is fussy, needs a diaper change, or gets hurt
- **Medical notes:** Add food allergies, health conditions — prominently displayed on name tags
- **Live updates:** Real-time class lists showing who checked in, at what time, and when checked out
- **Multicampus:** Check in children across multiple locations; show only campus-specific events on stations
