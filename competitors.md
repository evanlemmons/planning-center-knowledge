Note: This is not a comprehensive list of all competitors. These are the largest ones that we are aware of and have listed comparisons for on our marketing site.

## PC's Core Differentiators (Consistent Across All Comparisons)
1. **Transparent, public pricing** — no sales calls, no consultants, no opaque quotes
2. **No contracts** — cancel/adjust anytime, no penalties
3. **Lowest processing fees** — 2.15% + $0.30 card, $0.00 + $0.30 ACH (via Stripe discounted rate)
4. **True all-in-one integration** — single database, unified login, data syncs across products
5. **Weekly product updates** — consistent development cadence, visible via changelog
6. **Independence** — bootstrapped, founder-owned, no investors, no acquisition risk
7. **Fast support** — ~42 min average response, 7 days/week including weekends, no extra fees
8. **SOC 2 Type 2 certified** — security compliance that competitors mostly lack

## Competitor: Tithe.ly
**What they are:** Giving-focused platform that has expanded into ChMS. Owns Breeze and Elvanto.
**Processing fees:** 2.9% + $0.30 card, 1% + $0.30 ACH (significantly higher than PC)
**Where PC wins:** Lower fees (one church saved $26K/year switching), integrated platform vs fragmented suite, more features (volunteer scheduling, worship planning, groups chat, check-ins, tasks/workflows), SOC 2, weekend support
**Where Tithe.ly differs:** Branded app in App Store (own listing), AI sermon writing, custom app pricing
**Key risk:** Tithe.ly owns Breeze and Elvanto — they're consolidating the market but PC views the acquisitions as creating fragmentation rather than integration

## Competitor: Pushpay
**What they are:** Giving/engagement platform, popular with larger churches. Owns Resi (streaming).
**Processing fees:** Not publicly disclosed (PC calls this out as a red flag)
**Where PC wins:** Transparent pricing vs opaque, no contracts vs multi-year lock-in, faster support (42 min vs "days"), all-in-one vs needing multiple vendors, independence vs investor pressure
**Where Pushpay differs:**
- **Branded app customization** — more customization than Church Center
- **Hosted streaming** (via Resi acquisition)
- **Multi-lingual support** — PC does NOT have this
- **Parish-specific features** — PC is intentionally broad
**Key insight:** Pushpay targets larger churches with a sales-driven model. PC's self-service model is a direct philosophical contrast.

## Competitor: Breeze (owned by Tithe.ly)
**What they are:** Simple, affordable ChMS. Flat $72/mo pricing. Acquired by Tithe.ly in 2021.
**Processing fees:** 2.9% + $0.30 card, 1% + $0.25 ACH
**Where PC wins:** Cheaper for comparable features ($60/mo vs $72/mo for similar scope), lower processing fees, weekly updates vs development plateau post-acquisition, integrated platform vs requiring multiple logins, free Church Center app included
**Where Breeze differs:**
- **Customized onboarding** with data migration and phone support (PC doesn't do phone)
- **Free ministry resource kits**
- **Simpler** — some churches prefer Breeze's simplicity
**Key insight:** PC's concern is that Breeze development has stalled since the Tithe.ly acquisition. Breeze's strength was simplicity; PC argues they match it while offering more depth.

## Competitor: ChurchTrac
**What they are:** Budget-friendly ChMS with all-in-one flat pricing by church size.
**Processing fees:** Not detailed in comparison
**Where PC wins:** Customizable à la carte pricing (vs flat fee regardless of needs), free member database, free Church Center app, weekly updates vs slower development, modern design, task management, Music Stand, SOC 2
**Where ChurchTrac differs:**
- **Accounting and budgeting tools** — PC does NOT have this (Giving tracks donations only, not general ledger)
- **All-in-one pricing** — some churches prefer one simple monthly cost vs choosing products
**Key insight:** ChurchTrac's accounting tools are a genuine gap for PC. PC intentionally doesn't do accounting — Giving is for 501(c)(3) donation tracking only.

## What PC Does NOT Have (Gaps From Competitor Analysis)
These are things competitors offer that PC either doesn't have or acknowledges as weaker:

| Gap | Competitor(s) | Notes |
|-----|---------------|-------|
| **Multi-lingual support** | Pushpay | PC is English-only |
| **Accounting/budgeting** | ChurchTrac | PC's Giving is donation-only, not a general ledger |
| **Branded App Store listing** | Tithe.ly, Pushpay | Church Center is PC-branded, not church-branded |
| **AI sermon writing** | Tithe.ly | PC has AI for list building but not content creation |
| **Hosted streaming** | Pushpay (Resi) | PC relies on third-party streaming integrations |
| **Phone support / guided onboarding** | Breeze | PC is email/chat only, self-service setup |
| **Parish-specific features** | Pushpay | PC is intentionally denomination-agnostic |

## Market Positioning Summary
PC positions itself as the **transparent, developer-driven, customer-first** option. The pitch is: you'll pay less, get more features, receive faster support, and never be locked into a contract. The tradeoffs are no phone support, no accounting tools, English-only, and a PC-branded (not church-branded) app.
