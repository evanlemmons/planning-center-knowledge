# Planning Center Knowledge Base

A curated knowledge base about Planning Center's products, platform, and ecosystem.
Designed for use with Claude Code, Claude Projects, and other AI assistants.

## How to Use This Knowledge Base

Load files on-demand based on what you need. Do NOT load everything at once.

### File Index

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `glossary.md` | PC product names, internal terms, church tech terminology |
| `overview.md` | Company overview, product suite, how products connect |
| `pricing.md` | A la carte pricing model, per-product tiers, processing fees |
| `competitors.md` | Competitive landscape, PC gaps, competitor strengths |
| `security-and-compliance.md` | SOC 2, GDPR, PCI, security infrastructure |
| `legal-and-privacy.md` | ToS, privacy policies, data rights, compliance |
| `onboarding-and-transitions.md` | Transition paths, import capabilities, friction points |
| `developer-platform.md` | API, integrations, webhooks, add-ons, constraints |
| `blog-recent.md` | Recent blog posts with summaries (rolling ~12 months) |
| `changelog-recent.md` | Development changelog by product (rolling ~12 months) |
| `products/*.md` | Individual product deep-dives (12 files) |
| `raw/*.md` | Raw marketing page captures (reference only) |

### Loading Strategy

- **Start with `glossary.md`** if you encounter unfamiliar PC terminology
- **Load 2-4 files max per query** -- loading too much context degrades response quality
- **Products directory**: Load individual product files as needed, not all 12 at once
- **`raw/` directory**: Only load these if the curated files lack detail you need

### Content Freshness

- `blog-recent.md` and `changelog-recent.md` are updated automatically when new posts are detected
- Product files and other curated content are updated via pull requests (automated or manual)
- Check the "Last Updated" line at the top of each file for currency
